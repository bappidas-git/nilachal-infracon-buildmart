# Nilachal Infracon Private Limited — Official Website

A minimal, mobile-first **one-page business website** for **Nilachal Infracon
Private Limited**, an infrastructure & building-materials company based in
Nagaon, Assam (Northeast India), whose flagship retail brand is **North East
Buildmart**. The page presents the company, its products and construction
services, and captures qualified enquiries through a lead form backed by a
server-side store and a lightweight admin panel.

Built and maintained by **Assam Digital**.

> The site was rebuilt from a previous landing page through the ordered prompt
> series in [`prompts/`](prompts/README.md), kept as the rebuild record. The
> series is complete — see [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for everything it
> changed.

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** (CRA / `react-scripts` 5, concurrent features, lazy loading)
- **Material UI v5** + **Emotion**
- **CSS Modules** + CSS custom properties
- **GSAP + ScrollTrigger** for all public-page scroll animations
  (**Framer Motion** remains only for drawer/modal mechanics and small hover
  micro-interactions)
- **React Router v7**
- **Iconify** (`mdi:*` icons), **SweetAlert2**
- **PHP** server-side lead store (`public/api/leads.php`)
- **Web Vitals** monitoring

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Create your local environment file
cp .env.example .env    # then fill in the values (see "Environment Variables" below)

# 3. Start the dev server
npm start               # http://localhost:3000

# 4. Production build
npm run build           # outputs to build/
```

Admin credentials are configured through `.env` (`REACT_APP_ADMIN_USERNAME` /
`REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`) — they are intentionally **not** published here.

## Routes

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/` | One-page site (all public sections) |
| `/thank-you` | Post-submission thank-you page (requires a submission session flag) |
| `/admin/login` | Admin authentication |
| `/admin/*` | Protected admin panel — `dashboard`, `lms` (Lead Management + lead detail), `guideline` |

## Lead Storage Architecture

Leads are the product of this site, so they are stored **server-side** and treated
as a single source of truth:

- The public enquiry form POSTs each submission to `public/api/leads.php`
  (a shared JSON store) via `src/utils/webhookSubmit.js`.
- The admin panel reads and writes **only** the server, auto-refreshing every
  **15 seconds**, and broadcasts changes to other open tabs in the same browser
  via **BroadcastChannel**.
- There is **no `localStorage` copy of leads** — a lead submitted on one device
  appears in the admin panel on every other device.
- Duplicate prevention (by mobile number) is enforced server-side.

Configure the endpoint and its shared admin key with `REACT_APP_LEADS_API_URL`
and `REACT_APP_LEADS_ADMIN_KEY`; the key must match `ADMIN_API_KEY` in
`public/api/config.php` (copy `public/api/config.example.php` to `config.php`).

## Environment Variables

`.env` is committed to the repository as part of the existing agency workflow,
so **every secret in it must be rotated before the site goes live**. The app
reads exactly four variables (company/contact facts live in
`src/data/siteConfig.js`, not `.env`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `REACT_APP_ADMIN_USERNAME` | Admin panel username |
| `REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin panel password (rotate before deploy) |
| `REACT_APP_LEADS_API_URL` | Leads API endpoint (default `/api/leads.php`) |
| `REACT_APP_LEADS_ADMIN_KEY` | Shared secret for admin lead operations — must match `ADMIN_API_KEY` in `public/api/config.php` |
