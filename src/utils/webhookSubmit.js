/* ============================================
   Lead Submission Utility
   Submits public landing-page leads directly to the
   shared server-side store (public/api/leads.php),
   which is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for leads.

   Every submission — no matter which browser or
   device it comes from — is written to the server,
   so the admin panel sees every lead. There is no
   localStorage copy of leads: the server is
   authoritative and the admin reads straight from it.
   ============================================ */

import { siteConfig } from "../data/siteConfig";

// =============================================
// CONFIGURATION
// Server-side lead storage endpoint. The admin panel reads leads from here,
// so a submission made on one browser/device is visible to every admin.
// Same-origin by default; override with REACT_APP_LEADS_API_URL if the PHP
// endpoint lives elsewhere.
// =============================================
const LEADS_API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_LEADS_API_URL || "/api/leads.php";

// Phone number surfaced in user-facing fallback messages when a submission
// cannot be saved. Sourced from siteConfig (single source of business truth).
const CONTACT_PHONE = siteConfig.phoneDisplay;

// Server-side tele-calling storage endpoint. Telecallers enter records from
// inside the admin panel and they sync across every device, exactly like
// leads. Same-origin by default; override with REACT_APP_TELECALLS_API_URL.
